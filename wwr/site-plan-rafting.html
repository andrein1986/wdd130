    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Our task is to reach out to new clients to increase the income of the existing business. We are good at attracting a client who is young and has a lot of energy. However, young people do not always have enough money to practice regularly. We need to show that this is a great activity for middle-aged people who have more money. Such people can come to us more often and spend money. For example: if a family of 35-40 years old becomes interested in this, then we will get at least 2 new clients with a good salary, and they can often come to us. We need many clients like that.
    </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Our clients are successful middle-aged people 30-50 years old. They have achieved success in their lives. They have a good salary and do not save. They are tired of sitting at home and want some more active rest. They lack emotions, active habits. These people are looking for new hobbies on the forums of their peers and study other people's habits on the computer.</p>

You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
