    <h2>Andrei</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Andrey, I'm 36, and I'm from Russia. I'm married. My beautiful wife's name is Julia and she is a teacher. Now we live in Turkey, but we will soon leave in Canada.</p>
    <p>I have a degree in law and business. Now I want to become a programmer because it allows me to work from anywhere in the world. It's hard to start something new, but I think everything will work out.</p>
    <p>I love mountains and snowboarding. I always miss the snow and look forward to going to the mountains.</p>
    <p>I'm glad to be in this class with you guys!</p>
